## What this module does

`push` is responsible for **uploading NYC TLC trip record parquet files from local storage to an S3-compatible object store** (MinIO, AWS S3, etc.).

---

## Main flow

```
upload(data_dir, client, state, config) → walk data/ tree
  → for each *.parquet file:
    → compute SHA-256 checksum
    → check push state (already pushed with same checksum?)
    → if not pushed or overwrite=True:
      → multipart upload via S3Client
      → record push in state
    → return PushResult { uploaded, skipped, failed, total, uploaded_files }
    → if delete_after_push=True: delete local file
```

### Concrete example

```python
from push.core import S3Client, PushState, UploadConfig, upload

client = S3Client.from_env(
    bucket="nyc-taxi-data",
    prefix="data",
    endpoint_url="http://localhost:9000",
)
state = PushState("data/.push_state.json")
config = UploadConfig(overwrite=False)

result = upload("data", client, state, config)
# result: PushResult(uploaded=12, skipped=0, failed=0, total=12, uploaded_files=['fhv/fhv_tripdata_2024-01.parquet', ...])
```

### Environment-based upload

```python
from push.core import upload_from_env
from push.core.state import UploadConfig

# Requires: S3_BUCKET, S3_ENDPOINT_URL, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
result = upload_from_env("data")
# result: PushResult(uploaded=12, skipped=0, failed=0, total=12, uploaded_files=['fhv/fhv_tripdata_2024-01.parquet', ...])
```

### Upload with auto-delete

```python
from push.core import upload_from_env
from push.core.state import UploadConfig

# Upload and delete local files after successful push
config = UploadConfig(delete_after_push=True)
result = upload_from_env("data", config=config)
# result: PushResult(uploaded=12, skipped=0, failed=0, total=12, uploaded_files=['fhv/fhv_tripdata_2024-01.parquet', ...])
# Local parquet files are deleted after upload confirmation
```

## Inputs and outputs

| Input | Type | Output | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| `data_dir` | `Path` | `PushResult` | `uploaded, skipped, failed, total, uploaded_files` |
| `client` | `S3Client` | state file | `.push_state.json` |
| `state` | `PushState` | S3 objects | `data/{type}/{filename}.parquet` |
| `config` | `UploadConfig` | manifest file | `.push_manifest.json` |

---

## External dependencies

- `boto3` — AWS SDK for S3 operations (works with MinIO via custom endpoint)
- `minio` — MinIO client (used in testcontainers E2E tests)

---

## Architecture

### Dependency Injection

`S3Client` accepts an `S3Ops`-compatible client via its constructor. Infrastructure clients are never instantiated inside methods — always injected. This enables testing with `FakeS3Client` or mocks.

```python
# Real client (injected from environment)
client = S3Client.from_env(bucket="my-bucket")

# Test client (injected fake)
client = S3Client(FakeS3Client(bucket="test"), bucket="test")
```

### S3Ops Protocol

`push/core/ops.py` defines `S3Ops` as a Protocol. All raw boto3 operation functions (`put_object`, `head_object`, etc.) accept `S3Ops` instead of concrete types. This decouples the push module from boto3.

---

## Possible states / Lifecycle

```
START → COLLECT_FILES → CHECK_PUSHED → UPLOAD → RECORD_STATE
                                  ↘ SKIP (already pushed)
                              ↘ ERROR → LOG_ERROR → CONTINUE

After upload completes:
RECORD_STATE → WRITE_MANIFEST (records uploaded_files to .push_manifest.json)
```

The `.push_manifest.json` file is written after each upload run, containing the list of relative file paths that were successfully uploaded. This manifest is read by `extract` to skip downloading files already present in S3.

---

## What is NOT in this module

- Downloading files → see `extract/`
- Transform logic → see `transform/`
- Loading to ClickHouse/Garage → see `load/`
- CLI interface → currently a simple function call
